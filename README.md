# Halodi Robotics Recruitment Challenges

Small engineering challenges to evaluate candidates during the hiring process.
These challenges aren't meant to "test a candidate", but rather offer a starting point for discussions during the team interview.
We value *why* an approach was taken rather than *how*.

## Getting Started

- Each subfolder contains a challenge and an accompanying `README` with instructions.
- Your hiring manager will let you know what challenge is appropriate for the role being interviewed.
- Code-related submissions should be delivered as a fork/clone through GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab.

## Contributing

Add a new subfolder with a `README` and all the content that's required for a challenge.
