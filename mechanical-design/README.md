# Mechanical Design

At Halodi Robotics, we use SOLIDWORKS for our mechanical design.
Having a fundamental understanding of CAD, being able to quickly design complex parts, and explaining your thought process are important skills.

## Challenge

Given the attached PDF, `Mechanical Design Case - Part 1 - Design.PDF`, please:

1. Follow the instructions in the PDF and model the part shown in the drawing
2. Answer any of the questions asked in the drawing
3. Take screenshots that include the feature tree and the final model's isometric view
4. Document concise notes about your design process and approach
5. Submit screenshots, responses to the questions, design notes, and the part file (i.e., `*.SLDPRT`) to your hiring manager by email

If you do not have access to SOLIDWORKS, you can use the free online trial provided on their website: https://my.solidworks.com/try-solidworks
